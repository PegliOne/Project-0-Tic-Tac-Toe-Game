# Project-0-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A tic-tac-toe game made for the first project of the GA Software Engineering Course 


# Game Production Plan

# Technologies I'll Be Using
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- jQuery
- Codepen (the game will initially be hosted there, since it's easier and familiar)
- Firebase (to the host the game if I can figure out how it works)

# Step One
- Create an HTML file that displays the title, game board (either a table or a set of divs) and some instructions
- Create a CSS sheet that makes the page look decent (more attractive styles can be added later). Centre board using flexbox properties (not covered in the course, I know)
- Import jQuery
- Create a JavaScript file that programs basic game logic such as tracking who's turn it is, adding Xs and Os, checking for wins (I'll start by writing down and testing against every win state, then see if I can think of an easier way to test for wins) and changing display to match outcome
- Commit initial version to GitHub and edit readme file

# Step Two
- Add more styling to make the page attractive (colors, fonts, animations, hover effects, etc.)
- Optimise JavaScript to make it simpler and dryer
- Host game on CodePen and add the link on GitHub
- Commit updated version to GitHub and edit readme file

# Step Three - optional stuff
- Add bonus functionality to JavaScript files (keeping tracking of rounds, letting players choose tokens and select custom board sizes)
- Add local storage and networked multipler (if I can figure that stuff out!)
- Add an AI opponent (probably not going to happen honestly)
- Commit updated version to GitHub and edit readme file
